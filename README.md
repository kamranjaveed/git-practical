# Git Workflow Practical
## Commit States in Git
1. **Untracked**: The file is new and not yet added to Git.
2. **Staged**: The file is added to the staging area using 'git add'.
3. **Committed**: The file is saved in Git history using 'git commit'.
## Importance of Git History
Git history helps track changes, identify errors, and revert to previous versions.
- **Version Control**: Allows developers to track and manage code changes over time.
- **Debugging**: Helps identify when and where bugs were introduced by reviewing past commits.
- **Collaboration**: Enables teams to work efficiently by keeping a record of all modifications.
